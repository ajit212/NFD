 # Neelambur Foundry Division is one of the foundries that is capable of providing quality, reliable and competitive castings to its customers.
 # The challenges faced by the foundry is topped by one of the most prevailing problem found in many foundries that is nothing but the rejection rate of castings.
 # Significant measures with proper planning and execution may reduce the numbers of rejected components.
 # Thus, analysis of rejection rate is studied and suitable proposals have been made through the use of lean tools and an analysis software to achieve optimum rejection rate.
